# R3E SimHub Overlays

## SimHub Overlays for use with Raceroom Racing Experience

This is a small collection of Simhub overlays I use for Raceroom Racing Experience

The central cluster and the tire monitor were created by myself.
The radar and the leaderboards were created by others and modified to my personal preference.

## How to use
1. You'll need to have <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">Simhub</a> installed on your PC. 
2. Download the <a href="https://github.com/YvesCieters/R3E_SimHub_Overlays/releases">overlays.zip</a> from the latest release.
3. Extract the zip file and doubleclick each overlay. This will import the overlay in Simhub.
4. Create an overlay layout in Simhub and add the imported overlays into it.

The Tires brakes and slip overlay has a visual representation of wheelspin and locking. 
For this to work, you'll need the wheelslip plugin by viper4gh
Get it on <a href="https://github.com/viper4gh/SimHub-Plugin-CalcLngWheelSlip">viper4gh's github</a>. 
To install it, copy the 'Viper.PluginCalcLngWheelSlip.dll' file to your Simhub installation folder.
